;;; To suppress autostart on load change this to nil:
(defparameter *autostart* t)

;;; To test w/o autostart, after loading, go to package :e69 and enter:

;;; TODO:

;;; GENERAL NOTES:

;;; This file contains two separate, complete Elizas: one from 1969
;;; and one from 1972. Each has a function part and a script part.  So
;;; far only the 1969 version has been worked on. (Part of the point
;;; is to get the oldest working Eliza, but also, presumably once one
;;; is figured out, the other is easy.)

;;; ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

;;; Thanks to the following for assistance in transcribing this code
;;; from the original printouts, and then making it work: eMBee, Dave
;;; Cooper, Bob Felts, Saul Good, Ben Hyde, Simon Leinen, Patrick May,
;;; Charlie McMackin, Paul Nathan, Matt Niemeir, Peter De Wachter,
;;; Thomas Russ, Patrick Stein, and Jeff Shrager. Made to work in
;;; modern CL by Peter De Wachter, Matt Niemeir, and Jeff Shrager.
